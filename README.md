# 📧 Spam Email Detection using Machine Learning

This project demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow to classify emails as **Spam** or **Ham (Not Spam)**.  
It covers preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and comparison of multiple machine learning algorithms to identify the most accurate spam classifier.

## ▶️ How to Run This Project Locally

Follow the steps below to run the notebook and model on your system:

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd spam-email-detection
```

2️⃣ Install Dependencies
Make sure Python is installed, then run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3️⃣ Run Jupyter Notebook
```bash
jupyter notebook Spam_Email_Detection.ipynb
```

🧪 Run Predictions on Your Own Text
If you exported the trained model (model.pkl) and TF-IDF vectorizer (vectorizer.pkl), use this script:

```bash
import pickle
```

# Load saved model and vectorizer
```bash
model = pickle.load(open("model.pkl", "rb"))
vectorizer = pickle.load(open("vectorizer.pkl", "rb"))
```

# Transform and predict
```bash
vectorized = vectorizer.transform(sample)
prediction = model.predict(vectorized)
print("Prediction:", "SPAM" if prediction == 1 else "HAM")
```
